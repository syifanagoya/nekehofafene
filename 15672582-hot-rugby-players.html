Not only is he dead sexy, he also appears to be an incredibly intelligent, thoughtful person. I mean listen to him talking about his charity:</p><p>[quote]In discussing Eightytwenty Vision you have mentioned the frequent portrayal of poverty stricken Africans as hopeless, weak and unresourceful. Do you believe traditional approaches to aid have been partly built on racist assumptions? How is Eightytwenty Vision different?</p><p>[quote]Traditional approaches to aid have often been built around racist, colonial notions of the aid recipients. They frequently undermine the skills of those same recipients – painting them merely as the helpless, hapless victims of circumstance who have neither the resources nor skill to help themselves. And whilst it’s often true that they are resource poor – this is all too frequently the result of the colonial histories that have devastated their lands and sold off their natural resources to multinationals. Sometimes the question of corruption is bandied around – as if Africans were the first to bring corrupt governance to the continent – ignoring a long and sordid history of genocides, slavery, theft, corruption, environmental devastation and so on. At Eightytwenty Vision we firmly believe – not in an end justifies the means kind of rhetoric but rather that the means create the ends. So if we want to see the community we’re working with in Nkayi, Zimbabwe flourish, be autonomous and self sufficient – we can’t begin by painting them as simple minded peasants or merely publicising the disease and malnutrition that plagues their community.</p><p>[quote]So on an ideological level that explains our position but to really understand our commitment to how we do things it’s important to talk about our experience. The people of Nkayi are resourceful, dedicated, hard working, determined. They are fighting damned hard to create a future for their children that speaks of hope and dignity. They want their children to be fed and educated. To have jobs, a livelihood. To struggle less than they did. The women particularly are some of the most hard-working people I have ever met. They are enterprising and intelligent. They have learnt to pool their resources, to lean on one another. They fight daily to make a better future. Working in dusty fields they cannot even own, for hours on end, to grow food for their children. And while they work they sing songs to ward off laziness and complacency. They have the firmest understanding of the way joy and sorrow live alongside one another. There is no way I could paint these women as victims – even if it would generate more funds for them from donors here longing for a photo of a malnourished child to have their hand to their chequebook. It would be a travesty if anyone ever spoke of these women in a way that didn’t testify to their spirit and determination. This is not to romanticise them – they still struggle and lapse. They are not some sort of ‘goddess warriors’ or indestructible Amazonians but they are women whose dignity is so obvious upon meeting them that I would feel ashamed if I ever spoke of them otherwise.</p><p>[quote]And that is the image I carry with me when I’m battling with the difficulty of raising money or feeling the burden of trying to juggle so many things. And that’s the reason Eightytwenty doesn’t subscribe to a fundraising platform that is based on guilt. We are simply working alongside a community who well know their needs and have many skills to meet them – they just need some assistance in tools and training which we have the means to provide (thus far).</p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Offsite Link</a><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 18</td><td class=timestamp><span>August 9, 2015 11:41 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>Sorry, just following up on my prior post here, because after reading David Pocock's insightful comments about colonialism and the way that the west views Africa, I decided to read up on him and it turns out he's also a bit of social justice warrior (but in a GOOD way) - actively and unapologetically campaigning against homophobia - in sports and in the greater society.
