He had 21 writing credits to his name and appeared in more than 30 movies and TV shows. Thanks to a vast television empire that is still thriving, at various points he has been ranked as one the highest earning dead celebrities.</p><p>Aaron is also notable for being the father of Tori Spelling and <a href=#>Randy Spelling</a>. Upon his death, Aaron's will â€“ which was adjusted just two months prior â€“ revealed that he left the bulk of his fortune to widow Candy Spelling. Aaron left just $800,000 to each of his two kids. His will also included a no-contest clause which would automatically disinherit anyone who contested his will.</p><p>Finally, Aaron was known for building the largest private residence in Southern California, a mansion which became known as "Spelling Manor."

He grew up with mother Pearl, father David (a tailor), sister Becky, and brothers Sam, Max, and Daniel. His parents were Russian-Jewish immigrants, and David changed his last name from Spurling to Spelling after he emigrated to America. Aaron was the victim of anti-Semitic bullying by his classmates, leading to a nervous breakdown at 8 years old, where he psychosomatically lost the ability to use his legs; he stayed in bed for a year, passing his time with books, and fully recovered. Spelling attended Forest Avenue High School, then served as an Army Air Corps pilot during World War II, earning a Purple Heart after being shot in the hand by a sniper.</p><p>After his military service was over, Aaron attended Southern Methodist University, graduating with a journalism degree in 1949. As an SMU student, he joined the drama club and showed his school spirit as head cheerleader; he was also the first student to direct a senior class play at the school. Spelling earned a Harvard Award in 1947 for a play he wrote about racial prejudice and won the award again in 1949. In 1998, SMU honored Aaron with their Distinguished Alumni Award.</p><h2 id=early-career><strong>Early Career</strong></h2><p>In 1953, Spelling made his acting debut in the film noir "Vicki" and appeared on "Dragnet" and "I Led Three Lives." He sold his first script in 1954, to anthology series "<a href=# title="Jane Wyman Net Worth">Jane Wyman</a> Presents," and he appeared on "I Love Lucy" and "<a href=# title="Alfred Hitchcock Net Worth">Alfred Hitchcock</a> Presents" the following year. Aaron worked as a writer for Western anthology series "Zane Grey Theatre" from 1956 to 1961 and became one of the show's producers in 1960.</p><h2 id=spelling-entertainment><strong>Spelling Entertainment</strong></h2><p>In 1965, Spelling created Spelling Entertainment, and he also collaborated with comedian <a href=# title="Danny Thomas Net Worth">Danny Thomas</a> on Thomas-Spelling Productions from 1966 to 1972 and producer Leonard Goldberg on Spelling-Goldberg productions from 1972 to 1986. He took Spelling Entertainment public in 1986, and the public offering raised $80 million, allowing Spelling to pump out many more productions into the 2000s.</p><p>In the first decade of his producing career, Aaron served as an executive producer on several TV series, including "The <a href=# title="Lloyd Bridges Net Worth">Lloyd Bridges</a> Show" (1962-1963), "Burke's Law" (1963-1966), "The Smothers Brothers Show" (1965-1966), and "The Mod Squad" (1968-1973). He went on to produce long-running shows&nbsp; "Charlie's Angels" (1976âˆ’1981), "Fantasy Island" (1977âˆ’1984), "Dynasty" (1981â€“1989), "Beverly Hills, 90210" (1990âˆ’2000), "Melrose Place" (1992âˆ’1999), "7th Heaven" (1996âˆ’2006), and "Charmed" (1998-2006). Though Spelling had stopped focusing on acting by the early 1960s, he did make uncredited appearances on some of the shows he produced, including "Beverly Hills, 90210," "Sunset Beach," and "Charmed."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-302324 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/as.jpg alt width=900 height=575 sizes="(max-width: 985px) 100vw, 985px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-302324 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Aaron married actress Carolyn Jones (best known as Morticia Addams on "The Addams Family") in 1953, and they divorced in 1964. He wed Carole "Candy" Marer in 1968, later known as <a href=#>Candy Spelling</a>. They welcomed daughter <a href=#>Tori Spelling</a> on May 16, 1973, and son Randy on October 9, 1978. Spelling often cast his children in his projects, and Tori gained international fame for her role as Donna Martin on "Beverly Hills, 90210."</p><h2 id=death-estate><strong>Death and Estate</strong></h2><p>Spelling died at the age of 83 on June 23, 2006, at his home in Los Angeles five days after suffering a stroke. Before his death, he had suffered from oral cancer (which he was diagnosed with in 2001) and Alzheimer's disease. A few days after his death, Spelling's family held a private funeral, and he was buried in a mausoleum at Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery. Two months later, Aaron was posthumously honored at the Primetime Emmy Awards by stars of some of his beloved shows, including <a href=# title="Joan Collins Net Worth">Joan Collins</a> of "Dynasty," <a href=# title="Heather Locklear Net Worth">Heather Locklear</a> of "Melrose Place," and <a href=# title="Farrah Fawcett Net Worth">Farrah Fawcett</a>, <a href=# title="Jaclyn Smith Net Worth">Jaclyn Smith</a>, and <a href=# title="Kate Jackson Net Worth">Kate Jackson</a> of "Charlie's Angels."</p><p>Spelling left behind an estate worth $600 million, and he changed his will two months before his death, leaving just $800,000 each to Tori and Randy. Since the will included a No-Contest Clause, Aaron's children could not contest the will without potentially losing their entire inheritance.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-165012 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/GettyImages-51825148.jpg alt="Aaron Spelling" width=407 height=594 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-165012 class=wp-caption-text>Frederick M.
