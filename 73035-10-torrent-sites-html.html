Not many people know these websites, how they function, or even what they are. These websites enable one to download or get access to movies, TV shows, games, software, and ebooks in many cases for free.</strong></p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION: </strong><a href=#>Click</a> “See First” under the “Following” tab to see Briefly News on your News Feed!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/fae891cc902a5e54.png><p class=align-left>Using torrent sites to download <a href=#>movies</a> can be tricky if you do not know the right places to look. Some of the sites contain malware, and if your devices are not well protected, they can access your private information. Therefore, it is recommended that you have antivirus software or a VPN with malware blockers or adblockers.</p><h2>Best torrent sites for South African movies</h2><p class=align-left>Listed below are the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">top torrents websites</a> you can find easily on the internet, some of which have stood the test of time.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Top 7 VPN South <a href=#>Africa</a> 2019</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION:</strong> Never miss breaking news – <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">join</a> Briefly News' Telegram channel!</p><h3>1.The Pirate Bay</h3><p class=align-left>The Pirate Bay was founded in 2003 and is among the most trusted websites found online. It is blocked in over 28 countries around the <a href=#>world</a>, so if you want to access it from a blocked country, it would be advisable for you to use a VPN. Pirate Bay is also among the best torrent sites for games since it has a simple interface and an easy filtering system which enables you to specify what you want; this will save you a lot of time. The website also shows if the files are from users that are trusted. It has verified uploaders who upload quality content without hidden files, which in other cases can be spam files.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/7a0061d5141272f8.jpg><h3>2. 1337x</h3><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">1337x</a> has been there since 2007, and it has a loyal group of daily uploaders. You can find anything from the old movies to the latest music, movies, TV shows, and games. Als, it is among the torrent sites for Afrikaans movies. The website has a user-friendly interface, which makes it easy for you to look for any content. The content downloads contain information, such as the number of seeders, downloads, leechers, and when the moderators last checked the files. However, some occasional bad files that have spyware or malware can slip through, so it is important to keep your data safe.</p><h3>3. YTS.mx</h3><p class=align-left>YTS was founded back in 2011, and it mainly caters for movies from all around the world. It is very popular because of its high definition movies that can be fast downloaded. The website has movies that are favourable for anyone who has limited bandwidth because they have small sizes that do not compromise on the quality. Another great feature about the website is that the files are vetted; therefore, you can trust that you will not download dangerous malware. Nonetheless, a good adblocker or VPN with malware blocker would not hurt because of the pop-ups and page redirects.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/5a1f0497989041f3.png><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> 12 Top 9anime alternatives to watch high-quality anime in 2020</p><h3>4.

This will quickly help you choose the best out of the selection that has been provided.</p><h3>5. EZTV.io</h3><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">EZTV.io</a> came into being after the shutdown of the original site when its new owners took over in 2015. The site is among the popular torrent sites for the TV series that are clean with a range of resolutions. However, the site majorly leans towards on older series rather than the latest releases. You will also need to torrent each episode since it does not provide the option to download full seasons.</p><h3>6. RARBG</h3><p class=align-left>RARBG was founded in 2008, and it is especially known for its high-quality video releases. Unlike many of the sites listed here, RARBG does not allow the general public to upload; only its verified moderators can do so, which makes it to have a smaller collection of files in comparison to the rest. It is among the main torrent sites to download software from.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/69cc2c6b59a01566.png><h3>7.

If the creator has not, then it is illegal, but if the creator has consented to the sharing of the content, then it is legal.</p><h4><strong>Do I really need a VPN when torrenting?</strong></h4><p class=align-left>Yes, it is vital that you have a reliable VPN to protect your privacy and personal information, such as your IP address, which is exposed when you surf.</p><p class=align-left>Listed above are some of the best torrent sites you will find today.
