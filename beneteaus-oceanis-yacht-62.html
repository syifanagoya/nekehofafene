The idea that mass producers would ever dabble in these markets seemed a remote one. After all, the ‘big four’ of yacht manufacturing (Hanse, Bavaria, Beneteau and Jeanneau) all rely on churning out huge volumes of yachts at relatively low prices in order to make a profit. It didn’t seem likely that they would make a play for this market, yet the last couple of years have seen that concept shattered.</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s1>Jeanneau made the first play with its 64 and Hanse followed suit with its huge 675. To the surprise of some, both have been able to turn a healthy margin of profit by producing unprecedented numbers of these big boats. It was only a matter of time before Beneteau decided it would muscle in on the act.</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s1>The result is the Oceanis Yacht 62. Confusingly, this is a yacht in a separate bracket altogether from the Oceanis range and is actually the first of an entirely new line of yachts that will eventually feature a 73ft flagship. The 62 is also a definite departure for the Beneteau group in terms of styling. It has turned to its tried and tested Berret/Racoupeau design team but they have worked alongside Italian designer Pierangelo Andreani, who previously worked on their<b><br></b></span><span class=s2>Monte Carlo motoryacht range, for the styling. The remit has been to be bold and also adopt some of the motoryacht styling – an approach pioneered by Jeanneau in its 64.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/gc_Oceanis_Yacht_62_2016_2709.jpg><p class=p4>The result is certainly startling and definitely modern to the point of being brutalist. There’s a generous amount of freeboard, while the modern trend for squaring things off has been taken to new lengths – or angles. This angular approach is further exemplified by a thick black stripe running along the middle of the topsides. Sort of like an Oreo in reverse if you know what I mean. Anyway, this serves the purpose of creating the illusion of less freeboard and also hiding a number of huge portlights in the side of the hull which would otherwise tend to disrupt the look and lines of the boat. As with all recent Beneteaus, she features that distinctive arch over the cockpit which isn’t to everyone’s taste, but certainly provides a practical and sensible solution to where to site the mainsheet on a cruising yacht. No question: she is a striking yacht.</p><p class=p4>Step aboard and you immediately realise that she is also a genuinely huge yacht. There’s simply acres of deck space, even compared with a 50-footer, and it is here where the motorboat styling is perhaps most noticeable. The cockpit is divided into two fairly distinct areas, with a large communal seating area forward which is sectioned off from the ‘working’ area of the yacht further aft by two solid pods with the wheels and all the winches just aft. This means that, with all the sail controls led through channels in the deckhead and emerging from the cockpit coamings right next to the twin helming positions, the forward part of the cockpit is entirely devoid of ropes. This makes for a simply huge area to sunbathe and socialise.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/gc_Oceanis_Yacht_62_2016_1236.jpg><p class=p4>The instruments are also let into the coamings, with the remainder built into substantial pods on the steering pedestals. With a plethora of push-button controls for furling both the mainsail and headsail, everything is very much to hand for the helmsman. Meanwhile, the rise of the electric winch means that there is no doubt that, despite this yacht’s substantial size, she’s easy to handle shorthanded.</p><p class=p4>Aft of the helming station is a massive drop-down bathing platform which is accessed from either port or starboard by substantial fixed steps that look like something off a superyacht. The tender garage follows that theme, featuring an elaborate pull-out track for ease of deploying the dinghy, with everything done electrically. The tender garage is 3.5m by 1.7m, so this is far more practical than most equivalents seen on large cruising yachts. Between the steps down to the bathing platform is a bench that lifts up to reveal a sink and barbecue area. There is no question that this is a yacht optimised for lazy Mediterranean cruising.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/gc_Oceanis_Yacht_62_2016_479.jpg><p class=p4>Head forward along broad side decks with decent handholds and there is another lounging area let into the deckhead. Retractable cleats abound and the general feel is of high quality. Up at the bow there is a modest crew quarters that can double as storage, while the anchor is set well outboard on a substantial stainless steel bow roller. This is also utilised for setting the Code 0.</p><p class=p6><b><i>Down below</i></b></p><p class=p7>The interior volume has actually been cut down substantially on the 62 by the huge tender garage and also the crew quarters forward. Yet this is such a voluminous vessel that the saloon still feels genuinely very large. The layout is pretty straightforward with a palatial owner’s cabin forward featuring an en suite. There are two smaller but still generous doubles aft. The starboard aft berth has an en suite, while to port there is the option of either one double with en suite or a smaller bunk room instead. In the saloon, the galley runs longitudinally down the starboard side with the main living area and chart table to port. The chart table is decently proportioned and sensibly situated nice and close to the cockpit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/NCZ5486_fullHD.jpg><p class=p4>The styling is very modern and clean; it’s very uncluttered and most appliances are hidden behind covers to the point where it’s hard to identify exactly what the galley is until you start lifting up a few of them. There is just the slightly bland feel of a Travelodge permeating throughout. It is a supremely light and pleasant place to be, however.</p><p class=p4>The forward cabin in particular is a triumph of comfort, with a real feeling of space and luxury plus masses of headroom. As you’d expect, the yacht is absolutely loaded with electric gizmos and the options list is substantial. You can stick a washer/dryer in a short corridor that leads from the saloon to the owner’s suite, for example.</p><p class=p6><b><i>Under sail</i></b></p><p class=p7>The day of my test sail was one of those Mediterranean days where you wake up to a flat calm and spend the remainder of the day praying for the sea breeze to kick in. This did happen, but painfully slowly, so we started the test with about 8kt of breeze that reluctantly built to 12kt at its peak. Given that the 62 weighs a substantial 24,000kg, I was interested to see how she would perform at lugging a dishwasher, fridge freezer, washing machine and a million other gizmos around in a fickle breeze.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/NCZ5506-HD.jpg><p class=p4>Before that, however, we had to get out of our berth and, even in the calm conditions, this might have proven a challenge on such a large yacht. Yet times have changed: bow thrusters, stern thrusters and even side thrusters mean that such operations do not have to be intimidating. You can turn the 62 on a sixpence and she’s far easier and more sympathetic to handle than a 30ft-long keel yacht. It’s part of the reason that manufacturers have been able to introduce larger and larger yachts to their customers: by and large, these yachts are designed to be handled by their owners, not a paid crew, to this end, everything is optimised for effortless handling. This point was amply demonstrated when we unfurled the sails at the push of a button. The 62 needs a generous sail area to push her substantial displacement through the water and Beneteau has obliged with 182m2 of sail area. This is further augmented by an immense Code 0, pushing up her already substantial sail area.</p><p class=p4>It was fortunate that we were carrying this Code 0 as it proved the saving grace in the light conditions. This massive sail was able to drive the heavy yacht on at a good pace and, despite the very modest conditions, we were able to eke over 6kt out of her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/NCZ5331-HD.jpg><p class=p4>She was also surprisingly agile given the conditions and had a good feel. Often with these very large yachts it’s easy to end up feeling somewhat divorced from the action, rather like you’re at the helm of a cross-Channel ferry. Yet, with the 62, there was sufficient feel to counter this.</p><p class=p4>I would never suggest that the Beneteau is a spectacular sailing yacht, but what the French manufacturers have come to perfect over the years is the balance between cruising comfort and workmanlike sailing performance. It would also be interesting to have her out sailing in some heavier conditions, as that long waterline length and powerful sail plan suggest she could be good fun.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/gc_Oceanis_Yacht_62_2016_1857.jpg><p><strong>Sam’s Verdict</strong></p><p class=p1>Beneteau knows what it’s about and the new 62 is a fine vessel which is an absolute dream for anyone planning a lazy cruise through the Med in total comfort. She is easily handled by a couple, while the crew accommodation opens up another option. She would also do well in the luxury charter market. The yacht does not try to compete with the bespoke luxury bluewater yachts in the Discovery/Oyster bracket and the fit out is unquestionably not quite in the same league. Yet that is repaid in the price tag, which is astonishingly low, considering what you get.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirkZ65qrrGraadmaljwaa4xKCpmqiYY7CwetSkZpunkanAcK7IoGSbp5GperOx1aKcsGeSmrumwMSarKxln5iyorrIrGSymZOdwW6CkWg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./tea-heaven-resort-kamalpur-india.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tea Heaven Resort, Kamalpur, India">&larr;
